# PowerBI_Patient-Wait-Times_Report
This is a comprehensive dashboard designed to analyze and visualize Patients Visits data.  
The primary goal is to provide insights into patient visits, wait times, demographics, and other key performance indicators (KPIs) to support hospital management in making data-driven decisions.  

## Dashboard Description  

The dashboard includes several key visualizations and metrics:  

1. Patients Visited: Displays the total number of patients visited (9216) with a 44.11% increase compared to the previous year.  
2. Average Wait Time: Highlights an average wait time of 35.26 minutes.  
3. Walk-in Percentage: Indicates the proportion of walk-in patients (58.59%).  
4. Referrals Percentage: Shows the proportion of referrals (41.41%).  
5. Average Rating: Displays the average patient satisfaction rating (5.0).  
6. No Rating Percentage: Indicates the percentage of patients who did not provide a rating (72.7%).  

### Visualizations  

1. Visits Across Months:  
   - A line chart displays the number of visits per month from January to December (filterable by year).  
2. Patient Race and Age Group:  
   - A heatmap visualizes the time occupied by different patient age groups across various races.  
3. Time Occupied by Age Group:  
   - A heatmap shows patient visits segmented by age groups (Adult, Senior Citizen, Middle Childhood, Teenager, Early Childhood, Infant) across different parts of the day (Early Morning, Evening, Morning, Night).  


### Final Insights  

- Patient Visits: There is a 44% increase in patient visits from 2019 to 2020.  
- Visit Trends: The highest number of visits occurred in June 2019 and August 2020, while the lowest occurred in July and November 2019 and February 2020.  
- Demographics: The majority of patients are White, who also account for the highest departmental referrals.  
- Time in ER: Adults occupy the most time in the ER, especially during the Early Morning.  
- Visit Types: The majority of patients are walk-ins, with a significant portion being referrals.  
- Wait Time: The average wait time is relatively high, indicating areas for potential process improvement.  
- Feedback: A majority of patients (72.7%) did not provide a satisfaction rating, highlighting the need for improved feedback collection.  


### Suggestions  

1. Improve Feedback Collection:  
   - Implement systems to encourage patients to provide ratings, such as digital kiosks, mobile app surveys, or QR code-based feedback forms.  
2. Optimize Busy Hours:  
   - Early morning and morning hours are typically busy. Non-urgent appointments should be scheduled during less busy hours, or additional staff can be deployed during peak times.  
3. Manage Monday Influx:  
   - Mondays see a higher volume of visits. Ensuring adequate staffing on this day can help reduce patient wait times.  
4. Reduce Wait Times:  
   - Streamline operations by introducing technologies like automated check-ins or triage systems to prioritize cases efficiently.  
5. Departmental Focus:  
   - Identify and address bottlenecks in departments with consistently high wait times and low satisfaction scores.
